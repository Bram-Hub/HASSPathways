            "description": "This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Students meet in small sections to have class discussions and debates about questions like: What are minds? Are minds physical or non-physical? Do humans have free will? Does reliance on technology turn humans into cyborgs? How close are humans to building an intelligent robot or machine? Do we want this to be a goal? Students will learn how make a philosophical argument, and how to express them in writing or through an oral presentation.",

The cognitive models that this course covers are based on approximate Bayesian Inference implemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational techniques that have made this approach tractable. The objective of this course is to enable the student to develop models of cognition in a Bayesian framework.",
