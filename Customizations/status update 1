Status Update 1
Project: HASS Pathways

This Week:
This week I contributed some of the goals for the projec proposal we submitted. I also downloaded Node.js and attempted to install npm.

Next Week:
Next week I plan to start a terminology guide and begin correcting the color contrast of light mode for the website.

Blockers:
A technical blocker is that I have not been able to fully install npm using wsl. I am meeting with a team member to resolve this as soon as possible.
