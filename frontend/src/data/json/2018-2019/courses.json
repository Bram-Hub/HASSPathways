Traditional enterprises are moving toward analytics-driven approaches for core business functions. Data and information analytics extends analysis (descriptive models of data) by using data mining and machine learning methods, with optimization and validation, to recommend action or guide and communicate decision-making. Thus, analytics is an entire methodology rather then individual analyses or analysis steps.",

    "description": "The question of \"what is jazz\" remains a lively and contentious discussion to this day. This course charts the emergence, evolution, and influence of jazz music, as well as the many controversial musical, social, and philosophical questions it continues to provoke. The work of influential figures in American and European improvised music will be examined in detail, and the continuing development of jazz-inspired contemporary practices will be explored. Through listening, analysis, discussion, writing, and creative projects, students will develop a greater appreciation and understanding of improvised music in a great variety of contexts, and the crucial role American jazz played in revitalizing improvisational practice throughout the 20th and 21st Centuries. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify major figures in jazz and improvised music, identify different styles and eras, and have a basic vocabulary for discussing music both analytically and in personal responses.",
