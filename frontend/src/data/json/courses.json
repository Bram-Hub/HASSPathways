Among the techniques explored will be conduction, musical games, graphic and text scores, and cell-structure improvisation. Students will also be coached in techniques to expand and develop musical ideas individually and as a framework for group improvisation. No prior experience with improvisation is required, and participants from any musical background, including electronic and computer music, are encouraged to join.

Environmental problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society, affecting the way people live their lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of social organization and social practices. In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.",
