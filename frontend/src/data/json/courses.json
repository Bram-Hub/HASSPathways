        "description": "This is an introduction to environmental law and policy, with emphasis on the practical use and application of legal concepts. Students will work to develop critical thinking and advocacy skills. Professionals who work with environmental issues need to effectively argue for a position. Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA). Assigned readings for the guest speakers will replace those on the syllabus for that day. Depending on student progress and interests, the readings may change.",

Students will demonstrate their understanding of the topics covered by writing a detailed research proposal formatted according to American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines.  Students will also gain experience in using a selection of parametric (e.g., correlation, simple and multiple regression, ANOVA) and non-parametric (e.g., Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon T, Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman\u2019s ANOVA) statistical procedures. Data analysis will be carried out using R, an open-source programming language for statistical calculation and graphics, and R-Studio, an open-source integrated development environment for R.",

Is resilience about strengthening defenses so that \u201cresilient\u201d landscapes, infrastructure and organizations can bounce back, or is it more? Students will be asked to contribute to a collective understanding of how systems thinking and resilience thinking can help strengthen the ability to adapt and transform when humans are faced with social and ecological change. Can resilience planning help with the difficult conversations that are needed to balance the socio-economic and ecological trade-offs that the Anthropocene demands?",

        "description": "Sustainability by Design will center around student-led project-based research, with a focus on getting to know one\u2019s own specific potential, leveraging personal connections to communities, and making a difference in larger systems that can often seem intractable. Students will learn how to think and act within whole systems and design solutions that identify and push on leverage points in these systems. This process will bring analysis and design together in a multitude of ways, and the course can be thought of as a hybrid seminar/studio course, where students will learn about many design principles and practices and apply these lessons in practice, forming feedback loops between theory and action. At their best, students will transform systems from a degenerative state, to a sustainable one, and beyond to achieve regenerative systems.",
