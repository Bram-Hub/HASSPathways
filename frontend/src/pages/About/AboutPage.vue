            <h1>What are HASS integrative pathways?</h1>
            <p>Every undergraduate student at RPI must fulfill the pathway requirement. The pathway is a way to both guide students towards choosing courses and also enrich their HASS core. The pathways can vary from interdisciplinary to focused within one subject area. Each pathway consists of a 12-credit concentration of courses. </p>
            <p>See <a style="text-decoration: none" href="http://catalog.rpi.edu/">RPI Catalog</a> for the official details about pathways.</p>

                            <!-- answer goes in here -->
                            Taking an IHSS course is not a requirement for pathways, but for the overall HASS requirement. Although some pathways might require a specific IHSS course.

                        <v-expansion-panel-content> 
                            Check the individual pathway requirements. Some pathways might require one course to be 4000 level and some might not.

                        <v-expansion-panel-content> 
                            This is not a requirement for the pathways.

                        <v-expansion-panel-content>
                            Students are not allowed to create their own pathway.

                        <v-expansion-panel-content> 
                            Yes, lots of pathways even have an associated minor which sometimes might only require one more course to achieve.
